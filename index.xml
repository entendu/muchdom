      <description>Occasionally we want to populate Marketo fields with values we calculate on our side. Perhaps advanced UTM handling, custom Salesforce fields, etc. The Marketo Forms 2.0 API makes this pretty easy. Most of what you need to know lives on this documentation page, but I will give you a couple tips you might not otherwise know.
You can populate UTM codes automatically&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;but think it through. You can have Marketo autopopulate your utm values from the query string in the URL, but what if a user navigates to another page?</description>

      <description>In theory, full agile/scrum with two-week sprints is a major boon for everyone. Engineering teams agree to what exactly is expected of them, and the business agrees on when to expect their asks to be complete. Reality is of course never quite that simple.
One of the core tenets of scrum is that you don&amp;rsquo;t accept a task into your sprint unless it is fully spec&amp;rsquo;d and completable. For instance, if you get a task to change the text color on the home page, but the new color is not defined, you can&amp;rsquo;t accept that task into your sprint because without that color the task is impossible to finish.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
