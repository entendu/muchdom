      <description>This is an experiment with using Hugo to build a blog. I&amp;rsquo;m migrating some of my more interesting posts off my old site, brightbacon.com.
So far so good, I like having my content in Markdown but I sometimes miss the flexibility of a CMS. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long it lasts.</description>

      <description>How we built the Imagine 2015 site Originally published Feb 26, 2015 on Medium.
Imagine is Magento and eBay Enterprise’s premier eCommerce event held every year in Las Vegas. It’s an incredible event that many eCommerce merchants, consultants and developers look forward to year after year. At Imagine, people network with merchants, partners, developers, digital industry experts, and open source enthusiasts. We put a great deal of time and effort into making Imagine a spectacular and useful event, and an event of this magnitude needs a website to match.</description>

      <title>Use Marketo Forms 2.0 API To Populate Fields</title>

      <description>Occasionally we want to populate Marketo fields with values we calculate on our side. Perhaps advanced UTM handling, custom Salesforce fields, etc. The Marketo Forms 2.0 API makes this pretty easy. Most of what you need to know lives on this documentation page, but I will give you a couple tips you might not otherwise know.
You can populate UTM codes automatically&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;but think it through. You can have Marketo autopopulate your utm values from the query string in the URL, but what if a user navigates to another page?</description>

      <title>Interleaving Ad-hoc Tasks in a Scrum Team: Fastpass</title>

      <description>In theory, full agile/scrum with two-week sprints is a major boon for everyone. Engineering teams agree to what exactly is expected of them, and the business agrees on when to expect their asks to be complete. Reality is of course never quite that simple.
One of the core tenets of scrum is that you don&amp;rsquo;t accept a task into your sprint unless it is fully spec&amp;rsquo;d and completable. For instance, if you get a task to change the text color on the home page, but the new color is not defined, you can&amp;rsquo;t accept that task into your sprint because without that color the task is impossible to finish.</description>

      <title>How To Use Apache&#39;s Proxy for Drupal&#39;s Files Directory</title>

      <description>Drupal&amp;rsquo;s files directory can get enormous, and it&amp;rsquo;s best not to keep it in version control. Here&amp;rsquo;s a way to use Apache&amp;rsquo;s proxy module to point your local environment directly to your dev/live site&amp;rsquo;s files directory so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to download it.
In your httpd.conf:
ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On &amp;lt;Proxy *&amp;gt; Order deny,allow Deny from all Allow from localhost Allow from all &amp;lt;/Proxy&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Location /sites/default/files/imagecache/&amp;gt; ProxyPass http://dev.yoursite.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ &amp;lt;/Location&amp;gt;  Of course you&amp;rsquo;ll want to tailor it to your needs; maybe you want only one imagecache preset proxied, or just one directory specifically on one local host.</description>
